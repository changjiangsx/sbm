Extraction of Gold The extraction of gold by the cyanide method is of great technical importance.It is effected by lixiviation with a solution of potassium cyanide,the gold being precipitated either by addition of zinc or electrolytically.The process was suggested by Mac Arthur and Forrest in 1385,and is based on the well known solubility of gold in potassium. Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury. Although many miners use mercury in artisanal and small scale gold mining,it is possible to safely and economically recover gold without it.Mercury free techniques are safer for miners,their families and local communities.They may also help miners market their gold at higher prices. Should cyanide still be used in modern day mining?  · The concentration of cyanide used in processing is very diluted.Toxic sodium cyanide has been used in gold mining since 1887,and it remains the primary reagent in use for gold processing today because it allows for efficient extraction of gold from low grade ore.
