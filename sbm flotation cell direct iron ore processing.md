Beneficiation of Iron,Iron Extraction Process,Iron Ore. Xinhai increased anionic reverse flotation process of magnetic concentrate on the basis of the single magnetic separation process.Iron ore concentrate was obtained directly with a roughing,tailings were discarded with three scavenging,middlings returned to efficient thickener.Finally,iron concentrate was increased from 64.25% to 67.22%. Froth flotation Wikipedia Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing,paper recycling and waste water treatment industries.Historically this was first used in the mining industry,where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century. Column flotation of iron ore Column flotation is being given serious consideration for this service due to the low capital and operating cost of the equipment and the potential of improving metallurgical performance.This paper describes the basic procedures for examining the feasibility of column flotation for reverse silica flotation in iron ore processing plants. 1 Introduction flotation routes developed for iron ores,currently,the reverse cationic flotation route developed by the USBM branch in Minnesota is by far the most widely used flotation route in the iron ore industry.The two anionic flotation routes developed by Hanna Mining and Cyanamid,i.e.direct anionic flotation and reverse anionic flotation routes.
