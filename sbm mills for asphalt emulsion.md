sbm mills for asphalt emulsionAsphalt Emulsions Telfer Pavement Technologies Asphalt emulsion is a combination of three basic ingredients asphalt,water,and small amounts of emulsifying agent.In the same process,these components are introduced into a mechanism known as a colloid mill,which shears the asphalt into tiny droplets. INTRODUCTION TO ASPHALT EMULSIONS of suspension.Asphalt emulsions are no exception.To counter this tendency,asphalt emulsions are stabilized by thermal energy used to make asphalt cement a molten liquid,mechanical energy imparted through the shearing forces of a mill and chemical surface active agents.Asphalt emulsions used for road purposes have from 55 to 75% asphalt by CHARLOTTE COLLOID MILL State of the Art Product Processing The Charlotte Colloid Mill provides many years of clean troublefree operation.Advanced system design and construction furnishes a self cleaning action through normal use.Simply flushing with water or an appropriate solvent is standard procedure,resulting in minimal cleanup time and maintenance costs.
