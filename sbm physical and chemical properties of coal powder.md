Carbon,Chemical Element structure,reaction,water Chemical properties Carbon does not dissolve in or react with water,acids,or most other materials.It does,however,react with oxygen.It burns in air to produce carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO).The combustion (burning) of coal gave rise to the Industrial Revolution (17001900). Characterization of the surface and physical properties of A small shift of the SO stretch vibration in FTIR spectra of SLS treated fly ash is indiive of interaction between fly ash and SLS.Although the overall chemical composition of the SLS modified coal fly ash sample was not altered extensively,significant changes could be observed in its physical properties.
