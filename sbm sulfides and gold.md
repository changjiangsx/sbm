Sulfide Minerals The sulfide minerals represent higher temperatures and a slightly deeper setting than the sulfate minerals,which reflect the oxygen rich environment near the Earth's surface.Sulfides occur as primary accessory minerals in many different igneous rocks and in deep hydrothermal deposits that are closely related to igneous intrusions. Gold in Minerals and the Composition of Native Gold The native elements contain the most gold,followed by the sulfide minerals.Several gold tellurides are known,but no gold selenides have been reported,and only one sulfide,the telluride sulfide mineral nagyagite,ii:; known.The nonmetallic minerals carry the least gold,and the light colored minerals generally contain less gold Sulfide Minerals ThoughtCo The sulfide minerals represent higher temperatures and a slightly deeper setting than the sulfate minerals,which reflect the oxygen rich environment near the Earth's surface.Sulfides occur as primary accessory minerals in many different igneous rocks and in deep hydrothermal deposits that are closely related to igneous intrusions. What is the color of gold sulfide Answers Iron Sulfide is FeS,meaning that this compound has one iron atom and one sulfur atom.Iron Sulfide is also known as pyrite,or fools gold.The gold color is completely natural,but it is much. Black sand pyrite sulfides and gold &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The mining been done historically in the area excepting the alluvial recovery has been for the telluride and sulfides and gold recovered from that.Theres been no motherlide veins of native gold discovered historically afaik its all from sulfides and tellurides.

What is Sulfide Mining? Mining Action Group Metallic sulfide mining (aka hard rock mining) is the practice of extracting metals such as nickel,gold and copper from a sulfide rich ore body.Sulfides are a geologic byproduct of mining in this area,and by exposing sulfides to the air and water in our atmosphere,sulfuric acid can be created — threatening to poison the nearby water. sulfide mineral Definition,Examples,Identification. The sulfide deposits formed as a result of the first process include mainly pyrrhotites,pyrites,pentlandites,and chalcopyrites.Most others occur because of the latter process.Weathering may act to concentrate dispersed sulfides.Sulfide minerals are the source of various precious metals,most notably gold,silver,and platinum. CALAVERITE (Gold Telluride) Calaverite is one of the few minerals that is an ore of gold,besides native gold itself.It is the most common gold bearing mineral besides native gold.The element gold is typically either found as native gold (in its elemental state),as an alloy with other metals such as silver and copper and as trace amounts in a few minerals. Distribution of trace elements between carbonaceous matter.
