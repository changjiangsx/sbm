Drawing (manufacturing) Wikipedia 2019930&ensp&#0183&enspDrawing is a metalworking process which uses tensile forces to stretch metal or glass.As the metal is drawn (pulled),it stretches thinner,into a desired shape and thickness.Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and wire,bar,and tube drawing.The specific definition for sheet metal drawing is that it involves plastic deformation over a curved axis. The Modern Steel Manufacturing Process The Balance The Modern Steel Production Process.Methods for manufacturing steel have evolved significantly since industrial production began in the late 19th century.Modern methods,however,are still based on the same premise as the original Bessemer Process,which uses oxygen to lower the carbon content in iron.Continuous casting sees the molten Stainless Steel Grade 904L (UNS N08904) 2001117&ensp&#0183&ensp904L is a low carbon,high alloy austenitic stainless steel.It has excellent formability,weldability and toughness.It has good resistance to reducing acids as well as chloride attack.Typical appliions are in acid contact e.g.processing plants,pulp and paper processing,gas scrubbers etc. Production Process sunflagsteel PROCESS ROUTE FOR STEEL MAKING DIVISION.PROCESS ROUTE BLOOMING MILL.PROCESS ROUTE FOR ROLLING MILL.PROCESS ROUTE FOR BRIGHT BAR.Quick Links.Our Products Production Process Certifies Financials Customer Service Contact Us News.Sunflag Iron &amp Steel Co.Ltd partners Japan based specialty steel producer Daido Steel Co.Ltd.
