THE OPTIMAL BALL DIAMETER IN A MILL The optimal ball diameter in a mill 331 In accordance with Eq.2,the necessary condition for grain comminution is: 2 2 3 1 bo Kd.(5) So,we have got the following: the optimal ball diameter dbo is proportional to the grain. Grinding Mills TechnoMine Hence a rod mill generally precedes a ball mill in a grinding circuit especially where a fine size product is required.Ball Mills: The final stages of comminution are performed in tumbling mills using steel balls as the grinding medium and so designated "ball mills." Since balls have a greater surface area per unit weight than rods,they are.
