POST HARVESTING PROCESSING Secondary processing of cereals (or 'adding value' to cereals) is the utilisation of the primary products (whole grains,flakes or flour) to make more interesting products and add variety to the diet.Secondary processing of cereals includes the following processes: fermentation,baking,puffing,flaking,frying. Importance of feed structure (particle size) and feed form. The lowest extent of secondary grinding was achieved with the smallest roller die gap (0.30 mm),while increasing the gap resulted in strong increase of secondary grinding,which was also followed by an increase of specific energy consumption of the pellet press,and significantly better pellet quality.
