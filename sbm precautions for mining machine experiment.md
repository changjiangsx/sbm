Mine safety Wikipedia Mine safety is a broad term referring to the practice of controlling and managing a wide range of hazards associated with the life cycle of mining related activities.Mine safety practice involves the implementation of recognised hazard controls and or reduction of risks associated with mining activities to legally,socially and morally acceptable levels. Standard Precautions Centers for Disease Control and. Standard Precautions are the minimum infection prevention practices that apply to all patient care,regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status of the patient,in any setting where health care is delivered.These practices are designed to both protect DHCP and prevent DHCP from spreading infections among patients.Standard Precautions. A theoretical framework for Data Mining: the 1.Introduction.Two different interpretations of Data Mining (DM) can be found in the literature concerning this area.The first one,closely related to traditional statistical thinking,looks at DM as "data fishing" or "dredging" (Lovell,1983 Chatfield,1995).In this respect,most Authors are concerned with the reliability of Hypothesis testing procedures and model selection,when precautions when having aggregate impact.
