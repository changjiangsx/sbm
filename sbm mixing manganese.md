Manganese Simple English Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia This is made by mixing manganese ore and iron ore in a furnace and reducing it with carbon.This forms an alloy called ferromanganese.Pure manganese is made by reacting the manganese ore with sulfuric acid and electrolyzing it.Uses.Manganese is used a lot in steel to make it stronger.This is the main use for manganese metal. Manganese Removal From The Drinking Water Does the Be Manganese is a type of metal that is commonly found in the well water around the world.It occurs naturally in the soil.It is washed into the drinking water from the rain plus the surface water that seeps into the ground.Indeed,the manganese in the water can be a nuisance.

Manganese Simple English Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia 2019109&ensp&#0183&enspManganese is a silverygray metal and is part of the group known as the transition metals.It is similar to iron.It is hard to melt,but easy to oxidize.Manganese forms chemical compounds in several oxidation states: +2,+4,and +7 are the most common.Manganese compounds can be black,brown,pink,red,green,blue,and purple. Chemical Transformation I MIT OpenCourseWare Manganese dioxide alyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.Since manganese dioxide is a alyst,it is not consumed in the reaction.Normally the activation energy for this unalyzed reaction is around 75 KJ mole (MoelwynHughes).With the addition of the synthesized alyst,MnO 2,we can Manganese the third electric vehicle metal no one is Mar 24,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Manganese the third electric vehicle metal no one is talking about.A typical LMD battery uses 61% of manganese in its mix and only 4% lithium.so mining manganese
