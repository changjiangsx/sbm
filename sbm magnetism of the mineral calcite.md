Aragonite,breunnerite,calcite and dolomite in the CM The 14 CM carbonaceous chondrites studied span a wide range of degrees of preterrestrial aqueous alteration,and include falls and Antarctic finds ().The degree of aqueous alteration of each of these meteorites is described using the petrologic subtype scheme of Rubin et al.(2007),whereby CM2.5 denotes the least altered meteorite in our suite and CM2.0 is the most highly aqueously processed ().
