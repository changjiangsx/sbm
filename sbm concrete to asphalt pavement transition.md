Slope the vertical face of the concrete transition at about 20 30 degrees.This allows the asphalt interface to always be pushed against the concrete,thus more likely maintaining a closed joint between the two.It also provides additional support to the asphalt pavement at a high stress area. Powered by ProCure Pervious Asphalt Transition Among the common questions that I encounter are those concerning the transition from asphalt to pervious concrete.Most of the questions of this transition revolve around concerns of degrading the asphalt base with water under the pervious or providing some sort of edge support and when something is designed,it is typically some sort of ribbon or flush curb.
