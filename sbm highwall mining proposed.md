Mining Wikipedia Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension stone,rock salt,potash,gravel,and clay. Theoretical Analysis of Damaged Width &amp; Instability. To improve the resources’ recovery ratio and the economic benefits of open pit mines,the development of highwall mining is used to exploit residual coal.The design of rib pillar,formed by excavation and mining activities in intact coal seams,is crucial to the overall stability and safety of the highwall mining operations.This paper focuses on the damage caused to rib pillars by the.
