Coal preparation plant Wikipedia A coal preparation plant (CPP also known as a coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP),coal handling plant,prep plant,tipple or wash plant) is a facility that washes coal of soil and rock,crushes it into graded sized chunks (sorting),stockpiles grades preparing it for transport to market,and more often than not,also loads coal into rail cars,barges,or ships. OPTIMUM PROCESSING OF 1 MM BY ZERO COAL 1.1 Fine Coal Processing Although much research regarding improvements in fine coal cleaning has been performed in the last twenty years,the processing of material smaller than 1 mm remains difficult and results in very poor efficiencies when compared to those of coarser sizes.While cnki The dynamic properties of density and level system of heavy medium suspension in heavy media coal processing are analyzed,and the multivariable fuzzy control system of level and density is studied.
