Water cement ratio Wikipedia The water cement ratio is the ratio of the weight of water to the weight of cement used in a concrete mix.A lower ratio leads to higher strength and durability,but may make the mix difficult to work with and form.Workability can be resolved with the use of plasticizers or superplasticizers. Concrete Mix Ratios Cement,Sand,Aggregate and Water Concrete mix ratio is a vital topic in concrete mix design.The four basic ingredients for making concrete are: Portland cement,sand,aggregate (stone) and water.The strength of concrete mixture depends on the ratio in which these four ingredients are mixed.
