METALLOGENIC MINERAL PROVINCES AND WORLD CLASS. Cu,Ag,Pb and Zn.Several similar polymetallic deposits,although smaller,are mined at present.The combined cumulative gold production from these mines is in excess of 220 tonnes,sixty percent of which came from the Boliden deposit.Geologically,these ore bodies are related to quartz porphyry or other granitoid intrusions in a Metallogenic Mineral Provinces and World Class Ore. Roughly 80 tons of gold,4 000 tons of silver,70,000 t of Zn,55,000 t of Pb and 8,000 t of Cu have been produced during one thousand years of mining.The Kremnica epithermal gold deposit has produced around 20 t gold since the 12 th century and the same amount of gold is available in reserves of the planned open pit operation.
