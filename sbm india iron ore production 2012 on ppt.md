METALS AND MINING IBEF METALS AND MINING Crude steel production (million metric tonnes) Iron ore is a key ingredient in steel production.In spite of decline in iron ore production in India,steel production expanded at a faster pace.In FY16,India had a net export of 3.80 MT of finished steel where as imports stood at production of iron ore showing state wise share in percent From 1937 through 1953,US iron ore made up more than a third of the world's iron ore production the proportion of world iron ore mined in the US peaked in 1945 at 56 percent.Colonial.Iron mining in the United States began in 1608,when a ship returning from the Jamestown Colony in ia carried a load of iron ore back to England. List of countries by iron ore production Wikipedia This is a list of countries by iron ore production based on U.S.Geological Survey data.The mine production estimates for China are estimated from the National Bureau of Statistics China's crude ore statistics,rather than usable ore as reported for the other countries.
