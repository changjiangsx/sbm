How Does Acid Rain Affect Granite? Hunker Of all the building stones,granite is the least susceptible to acid rain because its composition is of feldspar and quartz,both of which resist attacks of acid.However the acid found in rain,snow,fog and dust is beginning to affect some granite buildings and statues,granite lake PPT Granitic Site in the Czech Republic and Paired .
