Improved recovery of a lowgrade refractory gold ore using In this work,different flotation preoxidation cyanidation methods are considered for treating a lowgrade refractory gold ore.On the one hand,the results of selective flotation show that 22% and 31.1% of total Sb and As,respectively,remained in the final tailings and only about 28% of the total Au remained for further cyanidation processes. Flotation of gold and gold bearing ores To overcome these particular problems,a pre aeration step was included ahead of the ﬂotation circuit at the Three Mile Hill Gold Mine in Western Australia.Pre aeration of the pulp allowed for the preferential ﬂotation separation of arsenopyrite and pyrite from pyrrhotite.
