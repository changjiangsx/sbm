Zinc smelting Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals,e.g.iron,because in contrast,zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals,zinc is a gas that will escape from a. Zinc Zinc metal is mined by using conventional blasting,drilling and hauling techniques.Froth flotation is used to separate zinc from other minerals after grinding the ore.The final concentration of zinc is about 50% using this method,the remainder being sulfur and iron.
