sbm does ball roll faster on grass or on dirtRolling Friction by Ron Kurtus Physics Lessons: School, Rolling Friction or Rolling Resistance by Ron Kurtus Rolling friction is the resistive force that slows down the motion of a rolling ball or wheel It is also called rolling resistance When a force or torque is applied to a stationary wheel,there is a small static rolling friction force holding back the rolling motion Does a ball roll farther on grass dirt or carpet Answers Nov 23,2011&#0183;&#32;Does a ball roll faster on grass or dirt? Dirt,assuming it is flat and dry The answer depends upon the velocity of the ball and what resistance there is in either the dirt or grass rotational dynamics Why does a ball roll? Physics, First when the ball is still slipping,the relative motion of the ground and ball causes a force on the ball which (a) slows down the center of mass and (b) increases the angular speed Once the ball rolls without slipping this force disappears Second when the ball does not slip,the contact point must be stationary Will Grass Seed Germinate on Top of the Soil » Best Lawn, 03 05 2019&#0183;&#32;Simply put,yes,grass seed will germinate if left on top of soil The seeds will need sunlight,oxygen,moisture and the correct temperature to grow,as long as there’s also soil that it can absorb the appropriate nutrients and moisture from However,this is hardly an ideal state for grass seeds If they’re just laying on top of the soil.
