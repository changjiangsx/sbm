Ewaste Precious Metal Refining System Precious Metal Ewaste precious metal refining system is designed to refine and recover precious metals like gold,silver,palladium(Pd) and platinum(Pt) from electronic waste (ewaste) like circuit boards,including CPU,RAM,pins,and other computer components.Ewaste is classified as hazardous material therefore should be managed properly.However,the presence of precious metals (PMs) in ewaste such as Melting and Refining Technology for Copper Produced Melting and Refining Technology for Copper Produced from Scrap Charge Our copper refining technology allows the use of higherimpurity charge materials,and still produce premium quality refined copper.In some appliions,copper produced by this method may compete with copper that underwent electrolytic refining. 12.3 Primary Copper Smelting 2015910&ensp&#0183&enspcopper oxide is then subjected to a reducing atmosphere to form purer copper.The firerefined copper is then cast into anodes for even further purifiion by electrolytic refining.Electrolytic refining separates copper from impurities by electrolysis in a solution containing copper sulfate (Cu2SO4) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).The copper anode Electrolytic Refining: Silver Gold Copper 20191120&ensp&#0183&enspCopper Refining Process for the Electrolytic Refining of Copper.This process is used at the San Francisco Mint to work up the copper occurring as base metal in the bullion,and to recover the copper used to precipitate the silver from the various washwaters.
