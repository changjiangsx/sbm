Occurrence,Preparation,and Properties of Transition. Transition metals are defined as those elements that have (or readily form) partially filled d orbitals.As shown in Figure 1,the d block elements in groups 3 11 are transition elements.The f block elements,also called inner transition metals (the lanthanides and actinides) also meet this criterion,because the d orbital is partially occupied before the f orbitals.
