What is Sand Overview and Geology Sometimes sand contains new minerals or mineral aggregates that were nonexistent in the source rocks.Notable example is a clay mineral glauconite which forms in marine sand and gives distinctive dark green color to many sand samples.In some instances glauconite in sand may come from disintegrated glauconitic sandstone nearby,but eventually it is of marine origin anyway. Which Rocks Absorb Heat the Best? Hunker The energy density of stone is the specific heat multiplied by its density on a unit basis.This gives a number that shows how well a rock can store heat,if every rock is the same size.The stone with the highest energy density will have the greatest ability to absorb heat,for a given thickness or size.
