First,there's really no difference in this context between stone and gravel and aggregate.In C 33 there's a chart showing the grading requirements for different sizes of coarse aggregate from #1 to What nominal maximum sizes of aggregate are recommended? Because maximum aggregate size can impact concrete properties such as shrinkage,and also the cost of concrete,the largest aggregate size consistent with the requirements of 26.4.2.1 should be permitted.With the w cm fixed,the larger the nominal maximum size of aggregates,the lower the cement content for a given consistency.Or,stated Classification of Aggregates Based on Size and Shape Coarse and.
