Mineral Resource of the Month: Chromium EARTH Magazine Although chromium is a metal,it does not occur naturally in metallic form.Chromium can be found in many minerals,but the only economically significant chromium bearing mineral is chromite.Chromite has been mined from four different deposit types: stratiform chromite,podiform chromite,placer chromite,and laterite deposits.Most of the world's resources,however,are located in. Chromite and Other Mineral Deposits in Serpentine Rocks Of. before 1900 totaled between 250,000 and 280,000 tons of lode chromite ore; infor­ mation is lacking for the other 13.Placer deposits produced considerably more Chromite: from the mineral to the commodity 2015 6 8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;and trivalent metal ions,respectively.Four types of chromite ore deposits occur as either lode or secondary deposits.Lode chromite ore deposits comprise stratiform and podiform deposits,whereas secondary chromite ore deposits comprise laterite and placer deposits.Chromite is an important industrial mineral used in the refractory industry.

Chromite: Mineral information,data and localities. Chromite is the most important chromium ore mineral.It forms a complete solid solution series with many other members of the group,eg.in the Chromite Hercynite Series,Chromite Spinel Series,Chromite Magnetite Series and the Chromite Magnesiochromite Series.It is the iron analogue of Zincochromite,Cochromite,Manganochromite and Magnesiochromite and the Cr analogue of Hercynite. Platinum Nuggets Platinum Placer Deposits Placer platinum is almost always associated with segregations of chromite,and,although not all chromite segregations will carry platinum,this mineral is an important indicator of the platinum group metals.Platinum is associated with the pre Cambrian,Cambrian and Ordovician terrains. MINFILE Record Summary MINFILE Mineral Inventory A general sample of chromite ore piled near opencuts analysed 2.0 grams per tonne gold and 0.68 gram per tonne platinum.No platinum was seen in any of the placer samples taken,but small pieces of a pale grey metal had been occasionally observed by men panning or sluicing for gold some years previously (Thomlinson,1918). Chromite Physical Chromite is an oxide mineral that an iron chromium oxide with formula: FeCr2O4.It is belonging to the spinel group.Chromite is the most important ore of chromium.Crystals are uncommon,but when found they are octahedral.Chromite is usually massive or in the form of lenses and tabular bodies,or it may be disseminated as granules. Chromite Ore Washing Equipment For chromite rocks,crushers,rod millers,jiggers canbe used while for placer chromite ore,log washer and jigger can be involved.Shaking table is also kind of gravity separators,but its capacity is low and its recovery rate is low,and it is rarely used in rough chromite concentration and it can be used in further upgrading of chromite. placer gold ore processing plant kunstmanufakturkreativ ore placer processing plant,ore placer processing plant.Alibaba offers 325 ore placer processing plant products.About 88% of these are mineral separator,7% are other mining machines.A wide variety of ore placer processing plant options are available to you,There are 325 ore placer processing plant suppliers,mainly loed in Asia.get price Photos of Natural Platinum Ore,Platinum and Palladium ore.
