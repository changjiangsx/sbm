To convert this value to WEIGHT or MASS of material that can be held,the weight (mass) per cubic foot must be known.Since cement is usually loaded pneumatically,the amount of air that is integrated in the cement must be accounted for to avoid overfilling of the silo.The following data can be used to determine the silo capacity needed. How to calculate quantity of cement bags in soil First of all you have to know how much cement you want to add to the soil.This is available from the laboratory.For example you want to add 10% cement so you will need to first calculate the weight of soil in a manageable stretch which is to be The Average Cost of a Cubic Yard of Concrete Hunker For reference,a cubic yard of concrete,which is 27 cubic feet,will pour a 9by9foot slab at a thickness of 4 inches.You would need 46 80lb.bags of concrete to pour the same slab.In certain communities,batch concrete,delivered,goes for around $80 per cubic yard. Analysis of energyefficiency opportunities for Nearly 40% of China's cement production is from relatively obsolete vertical shaft kiln (VSK) cement plants,with the remainder from more modern rotary kiln cement plants,including plants equipped with new suspension preheater and precalciner (NSP) kilns.
