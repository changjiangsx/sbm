Induction Motor: Working Principle,Types,&amp Definition 20191115&ensp&#0183&enspWhat is an Induction Motor? An induction motor (also known as an asynchronous motor) is a commonly used AC electric motor.In an induction motor,the electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is obtained via electromagnetic induction from the rotating magnetic field of the stator winding.The rotor of an induction motor can be a squirrel cage rotor or wound type rotor.
