Flotation Research Papers Academia.edu The flotation technique allows to improve the thermal characteristics of carbons that have high mineral content.However,in this process,the absence of control of critical variables such as the dosage of flotation reagents (foaming and collector),caused by the discontinuity in the measurement of the material flowing to the classifiion equipment (flotation cells),generates losses of Assessment of the flotation activity of reagents in terms Consequently,the coal grains become more hydrophobic,and their flotation is improved.With the same consumption of reagents,the use of 2methyl1,3dioxa2silacyclohexane rather than 2methyl1,3dioxane increases the concentrate yield and reduces the losses of the coal Flotation Characteristics and Particle Size Distribution of Micro fine.
