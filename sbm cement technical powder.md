Portland cement Wikipedia 20191016&ensp&#0183&enspPortland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete,mortar,stucco,and nonspecialty grout.It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the mid 19th century,and usually originates from limestone.It is a fine powder,produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln to form clinker,grinding the Glossary of Concrete and Cement Terminology 2008814&ensp&#0183&enspFor our purposes,the word cement used by itself refers to the dry unreacted powder.Cement paste: Cement (see above) that has been mixed with water.Usually the term implies that it has already become hard (see Fresh).Concrete: A mixture of sand,gravel,and rocks held together by cement paste.The world's most widelyused manmade material. Chemical Admixtures cement Sometimes,effects similar to those achieved through the addition of admixtures can be achieved by altering the concrete mixturereducing the watercement ratio,adding additional cement,using a different type of cement,or changing the aggregate and aggregate gradation.Five Functions Admixtures are classed according to function.
