Uses of Iron oxide Toda United Iron industry.The overwhelming appliion of iron oxide is as the feedstock of the steel and iron industries,e.g.the production of pure iron,steel,and many alloys.Polishing.A very fine powder of ferric oxide is known as jeweler's rouge,red rouge,or simply rouge. how is iron used in industry unionemolliese.it Dec 14,2006&#183 Iron is the primary raw material used to produce steel â€” itself an alloy of concentrated iron with a minute amount of carbon.Globally,steel production drives 98 per cent of the demand for iron,while electronics and nonmetallurgical uses drive the remaining 2 per cent. The Five Sectors for Steel Appliions Steel is both the most widely used and most recycled metal material on earth.From stainless and hightemperature steels to flat carbon products,steel in its various forms and alloys offer different properties to meet a wide range of appliions.For these reasons,as well as the metal's combination of high strength and a relatively low production cost,steel is now used in countless products.
