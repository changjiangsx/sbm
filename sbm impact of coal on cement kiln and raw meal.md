sbm impact of coal on cement kiln and raw mealPortland Cement Manufacture Portland Cement Production. In the portland cement production,most of raw materials should be crushed,such as limestone,clay,iron ore,coal and etc.The lime stone is the main raw material of Portland cement making,because its big size and high hardness,the lime stone crushing is more important in the cement crushing.
