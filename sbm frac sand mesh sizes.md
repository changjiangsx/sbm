Proppant sizes are generally between 8 and 140 mesh (105 μm 2.38 mm).The mesh size is the number of openings across one linear inch of screen.When describing the size of the proppant,the proppant is often referred to as simply the sieve cut.Since frac sand is easily friable,and creates fines when it is over stressed,resin coated. What is Frac Sand? And how is it used in fracking? Frac sand is a naturally occurring crystalline silica (quartz) sand that is processed from high purity sandstone.In its make up,frac sand differs only slightly from other types of sand,as grains of quartz silica are a major constituent of most inter coastal sands.
