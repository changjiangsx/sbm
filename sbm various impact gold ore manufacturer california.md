Gold,recognizable by its yellowish cast,is one of the oldest metals used by humans.As far back as the Neolithic period,humans have collected gold from stream beds,and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C.when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry,religious artifacts,and utensils such as goblets. Prospecting Encyclopedia: Geology of how Gold Deposits. Randsburg Gold District,California: Another model which applies to the origins of some gold deposits,suggests that gold bearing solutions may be expelled from magma as it cools,precipitating ore materials as they move into cooler surrounding rocks. The environmental impact of gold production The stages that contributed the most to gold's environmental impact were mining and comminution (crushing and grinding of the ore).Electricity use was responsible for just over half of the GHG emissions.This indicates that attempts to lessen the environmental impact of gold. Methods of Gold Mining Geology In Barrick Gold Corporation has one of the largest open pit gold mines in North America located on its Goldstrike mine property in northeastern Nevada.Other gold mines use underground mining,where the ore is extracted through tunnels or shafts.South Africa has the world's deepest hard rock gold mine up to 3,900 metres (12,800 ft) underground.
