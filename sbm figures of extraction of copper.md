sbm figures of extraction of copperEnvironmental effects on bacterial copper extraction from In bacterial extraction of copper from low‐grade copper sulfide ores,at least three contributions are made by Thiobacillus ferrooxidans.They are: (1) enzymatic oxidation and consequent solubilization of insoluble sulfides (2) regeneration of ferric lixiviant for chemical oxidation and solubilization of insoluble sulfides and (3) partial fixation of externally introduced iron in the ore.
