COAL CHARACTERISTICS Purdue University The fixed carbon content of the coal is the carbon found in the material which is left after volatile materials are driven off.This differs from the ultimate carbon content of the coal because some carbon is lost in hydrocarbons with the volatiles Calorific value,measured in Btu is the amount of chemical energy stored in a coal. Is Your Coal Retaining Moisture? The resultant coal is an extremely complex,mostly organic,generally well bedded sedimentary rock.” Because that coal originated in wetlands,it can contain little or lots of moisture by the time it is mined.And the amount of moisture present in the coal dictates how the coal will be used. Understanding the Geotechnical Report as an Engineering. Soil Moisture Content: Optimum compaction moisture is usually between 8 and 15% of the dry weight of the soil.Ground water will show about 25 to 40% moisture by weight of the dry soil.Supersaturated clay can be 50% water.Those are oozing mud that will not support the weight of even low ground pressure tractors. Identifying Moisture Sensitive Roof Rocks In Coal Mines Mine roof rocks tested with moisture sensitivity ratings above 50% (moisture sensitivity index ranges from 0 100 with 100 being the most sensitive) all came from mines which had roof skin problems and used supplemental support to prevent rock fall injuries.Some roof rocks showed lateral variability of moisture. Comparative Analysis of Moisture Sensitivity Index Tests. Moisture deterioration of clay rich roof rocks causes high numbers of roof falls in coal mines in humid summer months.Rocks with high moisture content are generally weaker and can further deteriorate when subjected to wetting and drying cycles.As a result,it is important to evaluate the moisture sensitivity of roof rock prior to mining.
