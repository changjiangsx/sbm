Magnetic Separation Mine Engineer.Com Strong magnetic particles may be easily separated with a separator having a low intensity magnetic field of 400 600 gauss.Paramagnetic particles (weakly magnetic) require a higher intensity magnetic field to separate them,generally ranging from 6,000 to 20,000 gauss.Particles that are repulsed by a magnetic field are called diamagnetic. How Many Types of Magnetic Separators? JXSC Machine In the actual magnetic separation machine,the magnetic field strength ranges from hundreds of Gauss to 20,000 Gauss,some even exceed 20,000 Gauss,but it is rarely used in general beneficiation production.Excessive magnetic field strength will lead to weak magnetic minerals to agglomerate that is not conducive to beneficiation. Gauss (unit) Wikipedia The gauss,symbol G,sometimes Gs,is the cgs unit of measurement of magnetic flux density (or "magnetic induction") (B).It was named after German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1936.One gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimeter.The cgs system has been superseded by the International System of Units (SI),which uses the tesla (symbol T) as the unit of magnetic.
