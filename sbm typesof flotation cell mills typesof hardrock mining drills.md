What replaced the placer mining Placer mining was the most widely used method because it was affordable to a large number of prospectors.If you choose placer mining,the crusher and ball mill is common. Jameson cell The high intensity of the Jameson Cell means that it is much shorter than conventional column flotation cells (see Figure 1),and it does not require air compressors to aerate the suspension of ground ore particles and water (known as a slurry or pulp) in the flotation cell.The lack of a requirement for compressed air and the lack of moving parts means that power consumption is less than for. Mineral processing There are a number of cells able to be used for the flotation of minerals.these include flotation columns and mechanical flotation cells.The flotation columns are used for finer minerals and they typically have a higher grade and lower recovery of minerals than mechanical flotation cells.The cells in use at the moment can exceed 300 m 3.
