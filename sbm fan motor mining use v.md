AC induction motors How AC motors work Induction motors in practice What controls the speed of an AC motor? In synchronous AC motors,the rotor turns at exactly the same speed as the rotating magnetic field; in an induction motor,the rotor always turns at a lower speed than the field,making it an example of what's called an asynchronous AC motor.The theoretical speed of the rotor in an induction motor depends on the frequency of. Difference Between AC and DC Motors Precision … Difference Between AC and DC Motors.Commonly ran by an AC variable frequency drive,an AC electric motor operates by applying alternating current (AC) power to the electric motor.An AC electric motor consists of several parts but the main parts are the stator and rotor.DC electric motors use different motor connections of the field and.
