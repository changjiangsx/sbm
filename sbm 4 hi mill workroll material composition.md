In hot rolling mills,premature failure of rolls is a major concern as it adversely affects the mill operation as well as production.Analysis of failed roll materials and actual rolling conditions in service are therefore necessary to understand the roll failure mechanism and thereby improve the wear resistance and extend the service life of rolls. Microstructural,mechanical and tribological. The microstructure,mechanical and tribological properties for three different materials,high speed steel,high chromium iron and indefinite chill iron,used for hot strip mill work rolls have been evaluated. High Speed steel Rolls Leon mill Roll China co.ltd 4,Application scope HSS rolls are mainly used as the work rolls in the hot strip mills and the finishing stands of bar mills; rings of the universal section mills and finishing stands of the high speed bar mills … A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANICS OF … on wear is another issue.Stresses from Hertzian pressure in 4 high cold mill back up rolls were measured years ago,the results were never published,but of high interest also,maybe later.K.H.Schr&#246;der July 2003 K.H.Schr&#246;der: A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANICS OF ROLLING MILL ROLLS File: SCHROEDER ROLLS 010703.DOC mill material composition skngroups.in material composition linier plate for tube mill for semen Home&gt;Crusher and Mill &gt;material composition linier plate for tube mill for semen.High … An investigation of worn work roll materials used in the. The surface failure characteristics of different work roll materials,i.e.high speed steel,high chromium iron and indefinite chill iron,used in the finishing stands of a hot strip mill have been investigated using stereomicroscopy,three dimensional optical profilometry,scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy. ROLLING MILL ROLLS AND ROLL SHOP Beijing… 23 Mar 2016 They are used to roll steel in the rolling mill and their performance Another important factor where roll life is concerned is the wear properties of the roll material.hence it is used in cases of high stress such as in plate rolling.have a work hardening tendency and are more suitable for cold rolling due to What are the Elements in the Chemical Composition of … The chemical composition of steel is reported on all material test certificates to EN10204.This article briefly covers the effect that each element has on the steel and why it is important or really not wanted.The focus is very much of carbon steel to EN10025.
