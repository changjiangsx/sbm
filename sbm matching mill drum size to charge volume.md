Ball Mills Fig.3.Rubber lining,grate mill.Ball Mill Charge volume.The mill power is approximately directly proportional to the charge volume within the normal range.When calculating a mill 40 % charge volume is generally used.In pebble and ball mills quite often charge volumes Rod mills,how they function 2012 11 26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Rod mills normally carry 35 to 65% rod charge by volume.The limits on charge level are (1) keeping the feed end trunnion open so that feed will get into the mill,and (2) keeping the rod charge low so rods will not work their way into discharge openings where they can cause rod tangling. Ball Mill Charge The type of mill also is a factor as if it is an overflow mill (subject to the diameter of the discharge port) is usually up to about 40 45%.If it is a grate discharge you will have more flexibility of the total charge.Ball size and ball grade is determined by the feed ore size and hardness,plus the PH level of the slurry.
