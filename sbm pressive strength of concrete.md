Strength of Concrete: Nature,Kinds and Factors Concrete. The ratio of cylinder cube strength depends on the level of strength of concrete and is higher for high strength concrete.However for simplicity IS 516 1964 has suggested this ratio as 0.80.Table 14.1 below shows that this ratio varies from 0.77 to 0.96 in an irregular manner.
