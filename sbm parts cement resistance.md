How do resistors work? What's inside a resistor? So while the officially stated resistance is 1000 ohms,in practice,the real resistance is likely to be anywhere between 950 and 1050 ohms.If there are five bands instead of four,the first three bands give the value of the resistance,the fourth band is the decimal multiplier,and the final band is the tolerance.
