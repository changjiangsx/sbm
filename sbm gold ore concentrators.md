Sulfide Ores an overview ScienceDirect Topics VMS ore forming fluids are acidic,reduced,1 3 M chloride solutions in which metals were transported mainly as chloride complexes (Table 3).Before the discovery of black smokers,temperatures of the ore fluids were estimated from rare fluid inclusion data and sulfur isotope fractionation between sulfide mineral pairs.pH values about 1 unit less than neutral (~5 at 250 °C) were determined. What is Concentration of Ore? Definition and Methods. The concentration of Ore can define as the chemical process of eliminating impurities like sand,rocks,silt,grit etc.from the ore for the extraction of metal.In this content definition and methods for the concentration of ore are explained along with the definition of ore and its types.
